# Ermis Catevatis - Skio Music

This project is a quick automation to build replication policies between two accounts, source and destination.
It will build the proper bucket policies and s3 iam policies for replication to work.

You will need to build a setup.conf with variables that are missing, read the bash script and fill them in appropriately.
setup.conf is sourced in replicat0r.sh.

If you have any questions feel free to ask Ermis
